This is not a game, this is more about getting information where you are able to know what does AMD and NVIDIA have as specs in each of their newest Graphics cards. You have an inventory in which you are able to store ONE GPU(Graphics card) of your choice. This will then foward you the price for the GPU. this works for both.

Type "NVIDIAG" to access NVIDIA's GPUs inventory or Type "AMDG" to access. Type the graphics card you would like to know about from the options that pop up and type the one you would like to add in your inventory.

I'm proud of the way I used for loops by re-using them in the same way but for different purposes

If i had more time I would make it more of a game style but that would be a lot, and would add an option to continue adding to the personal inventory.
